    OryggiAI Gateway Agent - Fix Service Login Error (1069)
============================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
The Gateway Agent service won't start and shows:
"Error 1069: The service did not start due to a logon failure"

This happens when Windows cannot verify the password you entered
during installation.


SOLUTION:
---------

Step 1: Open PowerShell as Administrator
   - Press Windows key
   - Type "PowerShell"
   - Right-click "Windows PowerShell"
   - Select "Run as administrator"

Step 2: Open the Service Editor
   Copy and paste this command:

   & "C:\Program Files (x86)\OryggiAI\Gateway\nssm.exe" edit OryggiGatewayAgent

   Press Enter. A window will open.

Step 3: Fix the Password
   - In the window that opens, click the "Log on" tab
   - You will see your username already filled in
   - Re-enter your Windows password (the password you use to log into your computer)
   - Click "Edit service" button at the bottom

Step 4: Start the Service
   In the same PowerShell window, type:

   net start OryggiGatewayAgent

   Press Enter.

Step 5: Verify It's Working
   - Open your web browser
   - Go to OryggiAI and check the Gateway page
   - Your gateway should now show as "Online"


STILL NOT WORKING?
------------------

Option A: Check the logs
   In PowerShell, run:

   Get-Content "C:\ProgramData\OryggiAI\logs\gateway-console.log" -Tail 30

   This will show the last 30 lines of the log file.

Option B: Reinstall
   1. Go to Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a program
   2. Find "OryggiAI Gateway Agent" and uninstall it
   3. Download and run the installer again
   4. Make sure to enter the correct Windows password when asked
